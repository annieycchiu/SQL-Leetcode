Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.


# Write your MySQL query statement below
with base as (
    select id, num, 
           lead(num) over (order by id) lead1, 
           lead(num, 2) over (order by id) lead2
    from Logs
)

select distinct num ConsecutiveNums
from base 
where num = lead1 and lead1 = lead2
